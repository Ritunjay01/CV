                  I am always striving to bring 100% to the work that I do and my goal is to
                  learn and grow as much as I can, and serve my best with the knowledge and
                  expertise that I pertain. My hard work and interest in finance had helped
                  me to focus on putting my skills to best use and to grow as a professional. I am a high-achiever, goal oriented professional with strong and persuasive communication skills and sharp
                  business acumen. I am a huge people-person and love exploring new places,
                  learning new things, listening music and reading books in my spare
                  time.
